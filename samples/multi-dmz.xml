<!--
	This configuration demonstrates a very basic DMZ configuration. The inside
	network can initiate connections with both the inside and the outside.  The
	DMZ can only initiate connections to the outside.  The outside can initiate
	http and https connections to 192.168.0.2 in the DMZ.
	
	A management workstation with ip 192.168.0.10 is allowed to open an ssh
	session to the firewall.  All machines on the inside are allowed to
	communicate with the DHCP server running on the firewall itself.
	
	
	The inside network is 192.168.0.0/24, and the dmz is 192.168.1.0/24.  The
	web server is running on 192.168.2.2.
