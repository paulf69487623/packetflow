Description: PacketFlow is a command line utility to generate firewall rules.
 PacketFlow is a command line utility that processes an XML configuration
 to generate a set of firewall rules. It is intended to be installed and
 run directly on the firewall itself. PacketFlow was designed to deal with
 complex multi-interface configurations.  It can gracefully deal with 5 or
 more interfaces.
